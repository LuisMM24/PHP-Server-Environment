<h2>email:luism@gmail.com</h2>
<h2>pass:test123</h2>

When you are in "panel.php", the log out option will be avaiable, and if you click, it will display a success msg of log out.

If you try to access through the url, the page will display an error msg.
If the email or password are incorrect, it will back up to the index again, displaying an error msg too.
